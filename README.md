# CRC-Cyclic-Redundancy-Check-
Commonly used in digital networks and storage devices to identify unintentional alterations to digital data. CRC or Cyclic Redundancy Check is a method of detecting accidental changes/errors in the communication channel.

The MODULO algorithm serves as the foundation for the CRC, a complicated algorithm evolved from the CHECKSUM error detection technique. For executing the computations, it is relied on the value of polynomial coefficients in binary format.
